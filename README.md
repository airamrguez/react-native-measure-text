### Manual installation

#### iOS

1.  In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
2.  Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-measure-text` and add `RNMeasureText.xcodeproj`

* Add `import io.github.airamrguez.RNMeasureTextPackage;` to the imports at the top of the file
* Add `new RNMeasureTextPackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method

2.  Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
    ```
    include ':react-native-measure-text'
    project(':react-native-measure-text').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-measure-text/android')

    ```

## Usage

```javascript
import MeasureText from 'react-native-measure-text';

const texts = [
  'This is an example',
  'This is the second line'
];
const width = 100;
const fontSize = 15;
const fontFamily = 'Arvo';

class Test extends Component {
  state = {
    heights: [],
  }
  async componentDidMount() {
    const heights = await MeasureText.heights({(
      texts, /* texts to measure */
      width, /* container width */
      fontSize,
      fontFamily /* fontFamily is optional! */
    );
    this.setState({ heights });
  }
  render() {
    const { heights } = this.state;
    return (
      <View>
        {texts.map((text, i) => (
          <Text
            key={`text-${i}`}
            style={{
              width,
              fontSize,
              fontFamily,
              height: heights[i],
            }}
          >
            {text}
          </Text>
        ))}
    </View>
  }
}
```

## API

`MeasureText.heights(options)`

Returns a promise that resolves to all the heights of the texts passed in options.

`MeasureText.widths(options)`

Returns a promise that resolves to all the widths of the texts passed in options.

Measure options:

* `texts`: An array of texts to measure.
* `width`: Container width when you want to measure the height.
* `height`: Container height when you want to measure the width.
* `fontSize`: The size of the font.
* `fontFamily`: The name of a _custom_ font or a _preinstalled_ font. This is optional.
* `fontWeight`: Specifies font weight. The values are the same that React Native allows: `enum('normal', 'bold', '100', '200', '300', '400', '500', '600', '700', '800', '900')`

## How to use a custom font?

Follow these steps:

1.  Create `assets/fonts` at the root of your React Native project.
2.  Add this piece of JSON into your `package.json` file:

```
  "rnpm": {
    "assets": [
      "./assets/fonts/"
    ]
  }
```

3.  If you want to use the same font cross-platform, in order to avoid platform incompatibility issues, be sure that your font file name matches the font name! For example if the font name is "Arvo" the file should be named "Arvo.ttf". You can specify different fonts for each platform if you want.
4.  Run the command `react-native link` on the root of your project to link the added fonts.

## Using `fontWeight`

If you are using custom fonts then you have to add the **bold** version into the `assets/fonts` directory. Follow the convention that React Native applies. Extracted from the docs:

> Given a "family" font family the files in the assets/fonts folder need to be family.ttf (.otf) family_bold.ttf(.otf) family_italic.ttf(.otf) and family_bold_italic.ttf(.otf)

You're ready to go!
